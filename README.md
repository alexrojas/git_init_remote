-BEATLES.RB
This small project all it does is use a While loop, matching the attribute of each Beatle to each name. So we locate the nickname on on a hash inside of an array, once we have that we print each individual Beatle with its correct attribute. 

—FINALREPLGAME.rb
ThIs project is the game we created, This game consists on filling the empty letter of a work. We start by using a gem called “cowsay” that gives a nice image of a cow saying whatever name the user inputs. After asking couple of questions, the user or player enters the missing letter and advance to the next level. And if there is any entry not wanted, the loop makes the program to ask again, and again, until the answer is the correct one. 

-MENU.rb
This project consists on printing the code, to a nice layout that looks like a real restaurant menu. We create an Array with hashes, and then we use a case statement to print  whatever part of the code we want.
